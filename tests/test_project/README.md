# Django Test Project

This is a barebones, as-minimal-as-possible Django project that is solely meant for testing.
Outside of the actual test files, the other files are the minimum configuration necessary for getting this project to run with `pytest-django`.

In order to run these tests, see [maidfile.md](../../maidfile.md) in the root directory of the repo.
